## The Need For A Web Developer Portfolio

<br/>

Naively, I thought after achieving my masters in mobile and web development in May 2020 would serve as enough, 'evidence' to future employers as to my core competency in becoming a junior web developer.  My thoughts were wrong.



While academic qualifications are highly regarded in the industry, it seems they have to be juxtaposed with a body of work for potential employers and clients alike to peruse to enable them to make an, 'informed decision' on whether to progress with the candidate through the selection process.

I was a little bit disappointed with this feedback after my brief foray into the job market, considering, like many others developers I have been inundated with countless articles (from BBC no less) on the great need for coders and that there appears to be a massive shortfall for the industry to fill.

Being that this is no place to discuss, debate and try and deduce why this phenomenon is manifesting in this way, nevertheless it is a reality.  A web developer portfolio is a must these days to become considered for work.  Therefore a web developer portfolio from myself has been developed.

### The Journey - A Reality Check

</br>



In progressing with this portfolio, which as an entity, will be continually worked on throughout my prospective career path, I realised after graduating I was short on a few key areas to be considered employment ready.

I wouldn't change my university education experience for the world, it was a fulfilling process to go through.   However, justifying educating a student to masters level, consequently, means there is a massive theoretical input compelling students to undertake.  Often at the expense at the practical side of things.

Having said that, this doesn't mean I am ungrateful for the opportunity to go in, 'deep' to the hows and whys of development and the IT industry, nevertheless, the benefits of which will only be felt later on down my career path when I can get my commercial experience to a s deep and meaningful as the theory.
