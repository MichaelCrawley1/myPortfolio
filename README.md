## The Need For A Web Developer Portfolio

<br/>

Naively, I thought after achieving my masters in mobile and web development in May 2020 would serve as enough, 'evidence' to future employers as to my core competency in becoming a junior web developer.  My thoughts were wrong.



While academic qualifications are highly regarded in the industry, it seems they have to be juxtaposed with a body of work to showcase to potential employers and clients alike.  This is to enable a more, 'informed decision' on whether to progress with the candidate through the selection process.

I was a little bit disappointed with this feedback after my brief foray into the job market, considering, like with many other potential developers I have been inundated with countless articles ([from BBC no less](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53438262)) on the great need for coders and that there appears to be a massive shortfall for the industry to fill.

Being that this is no place to discuss, debate to try and deduce why new developers are struggling with the high barriers to entry to the workforce, nevertheless it is a reality.

One of these barriers is the portfolio itself.  A web developer portfolio is a must these days to become considered for work.  Therefore a web developer portfolio from myself has been developed.






<!---

</br>


### The Journey - A Reality Check

</br>



In progressing with this portfolio, which as an entity, will be continually worked on throughout my prospective career path, I realised after graduating I was short on a few key areas to be considered employment ready.  Going through this process perhaps gave me an inside perspective as to the answering the aforementioned, 'why?' web developers portfolios are such an essential job requirement.

</br>

##### My University Experience

</br>

I wouldn't change my university education experience for the world, it was a fulfilling process to go through.   However, justifying educating a student to masters level, consequently, means there is a massive theoretical input students have to undertake.  Often at the expense at the practical side of things.

That is not to say the deep learning and 'mastery' for want of a better word, of the many layered theoretical side of web development will not prove beneficial years into my career, however, perhaps is not the ideal way to begin for aspiring web developers.

In retrospect, perhaps a more college, 'trade-school' approach would have been a better preparation.  Here the onus is on the code itself and getting the many heterogeneous connecting parts to work together.  Understanding the, 'why' of this highly coupled, interdependent entity that is a, 'web app' comes later. Sort of like the bottom up approach rather than the top down route the universities take.

<br/>


##### My University CRUD App

<br/>

For example, one of the few practical tasks I had to undertake at my time in university was the creation of a create, read update, delete (CRUD) music web app [My CRUD APP](https://github.com/MichaelCrawley1/metallicaTourProject).   While this was an excellent learning opportunity for a student to undertake, however, due to time constraints the end result, particularly from the user interface (UI) point of view, was somewhat truncated. As far as model,view, controller (MVC) architecture is concerned,  the heavy portion of time and rightly so, was spent by the student getting the model (the database) queries to communicate to the control (PHP language in this case).

However as a consequence to these time constraints the ever important, 'view' side of things was rushed.  The student could take the design of other music sites and used that as a template for their own project and since it only had to be displayed on one screen size (1980px - the size of the lab university monitors) meant the site didn't need to be responsive, therefore the view could be done very quickly indeed.

<br/>

##### The Right Thing To do

<br/>




The CRUD app and CRUD apps in general are data driven entities so it was the right thing to do as far as the university was concerned to focus the main bulk of the time on getting the data to work with the UI.  

Having said that, an effective UI is so important for web developers to be considered for roles - even if they aspire to be back-end (non-view) developers.  If the potential recruiter can't see, what the developer has coded then they will be, more than likely to be considered 'not good enough'.



In retrospect, I could have done the same thing we were encouraged to do at university and truncated the view side of things with this portfolio.  I could have borrowed a template and used some UI frameworks and cobbled it all together and started to apply for roles.

However, that didn't sit well with me. I want and aspire to be a full stack developer, therefore no side of the MVC architecture to me takes precedence.  I see it as one piece, and I want to master this one piece.  To do this, I believe one must learn to core a full stack application with just the core languages - especially in the beginning of their journey.  

This is far as I can tell is the perfect way to grow and learn this complicated hetreogenous platform that is a web app.  Then when that understanding is met, is when one can then abstract that way of programming to the many excellnebt, valaubel frameworks avalible, Angular and Reat are prime examples.    

While this would give the, 'sight' that recruiters need to see, I would know I would be cheating myself - I don't know how this thing I have created works.  That didn't sit well with me.  

So I took the time I needed to fill that shortfall of view side of things on my tool box.  In no particular order I have used this portfolio to demonstrate I now know how to use, the powerful tools that are grid and flex box, bem, mobile first approach, responsive, component driven project.    





Having said that, this doesn't mean I am ungrateful for the opportunity to go in, 'deep' to the, 'hows' and 'whys' of development and the IT industry, nevertheless, the benefits of which will only be felt later on down my career path when I can get my commercial experience to a s deep and meaningful as the theory.

# Description


A web developer portfolio site to me is best thought as a hub that stores all your best work that gives you the best chance to land new clients or obtain a good employment position as  a web developer.  Consequently the design has to communicate the following:

<br/> 

- **Who you are**
- **Relevant Education**
- **Relevant Skills**
- **What you can do for the potential employer/client**
- **Project Examples backing up your claim of what you can do for the employer/client**
- **A way to get in contact with you for further discussion**
- **Relevant Social Media Profiles**

<br/>

Since you want to communicate the above, first the design (which will then become the face of the UI) has to be; clean, responsive, intuitive and one that reflects your personality.

I feel I have done just that with this site.  My personality type is very businesslike having transferred over from sales and marketing in my past career therefore I wanted a portfolio to reflect that businesslike personality of mine.

However to do this I needed some inspiration and help.  Enter Kevin Powell.

<br/>

***Kevin Powell's Portfolio Grid Tutorial***
![Kevin Powell Portfolio Tutorial With CSS Grid](https://i.imgur.com/58SD5M0.jpg "this is kevin's video")[The Link For Kevin Powell's CSS Grid Portfolio Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRuMoGNcJfw&t=2s)

<br/>  

For those that don't know, Kevin Powell is considered by many to be a CSS expert in the web development community and is very successful and prominent CSS figure in YouTube.  Kevin, if you ever read this, please can I take this opportunity to say thank you so much for your CSS tips that you share.  You have helped make a logical programmer like myself; understand, create and develop professional looking web site user interfaces (UIs) with your uncanny ability to take this seemingly easy to understand but frustrating language to execute  that is CSS and make us logical minded thinkers, 'get it'.

Of the model view controller (MVC) architecture, the view side of things has always been the bottleneck to me applying for developing positions.  Thanks to people like Kevin Powell that is no longer the case.  I feel I can do most things now with CSS and I am very confident moving forward with my ambition of becoming a full stack web developer.  Hopefully this portfolio site and my development projects uploaded onto this site serve to illustrate that improvement in my development journey.

# Lessons Learned - The Design

</br>





#### Design - Colour Theory

<br/>

I realise this is a place to talk about the actual code of the project and I will get to this very shortly.  However, I want to mention the importance of being able to design professional looking interfaces.  

I never came into this industry with any ambition to be a designer.  However, as mentioned, I do have ambitions to become a full stack developer, I like the idea of being able to, 'do it all'.  Giving this ambition I dedicated a good 3  to 6 months of my time after university to learn the adobe XD's design tool and learning  the importance of making compelling website designs for industry.

It was a great thing for me to do because my past somewhat rudimentary website designs are now, I think, professional enough to prospect new business with.  I learned a lot of this again from the aforementioned Kevin Powell and a Udemy course provided by (Cristian Doru Barin).

<br/>


***Udemy Certificate - Adobe XD Masterclass (Cristian Doru Barin)***
![udemy certificate](https://i.imgur.com/l92iG4j.png "My Udemy Certificate")  

<br/>

In no particular order what I learned is the following:

<br/>

- **The three second rule** 
- **Write content for the user not for yourself**
- **The need for contrasting, be it fonts, colours text size exactly**
- **Call to Action positions**
- **Two fonts, three max**
- **Primary, Secondary and maybe a tertiary colour for CTA buttons**
- **The use of light greys and different darker shades** 
- **Overlays and linear gradients**
- **Use Analytic tools to see how the users are responding to your site to continually improve design**

<br/>


Enclosed are my wireframes and site navigation design for mobile and desktop from Adobe XD that are now represented in this portfolio website.

<br/>

***Adobe XD Wireframes For This Portfolio Project***
![design portfolio path](https://i.imgur.com/l3ZOxNU.png "the wireframe pathways for mobile and desktop")    

<br/>

#### The Three Second Rule

<br/>


The three second rule was a great thing to be aware of.  What this means, a  user typically makes their decision to peruse or leave your website in three seconds!  In other words you have three seconds to answer the following user questions:

- What the business/website does?
- Why the user should use this business/website?
- What to do next?

Designing and developing websites in the future with a view to answering those essential three question will be made great use of going forward. 

<br/>

#### Write For The User Not For Yourself

<br/>

This was also great to learn.  Coming from a life of sales I am very aware of the power of intangibles, something somewhat derogatory refereed to as, 'soft-skills'.  Things like; tone of voice,  appropriate words, active listening, identifying the user's need and then solving that need.

I always wondered how does effective written content on the internet do the same thing.  It turns out instead of writing what you can do for the user using words like, "I, me etc" you write as if you were the user themselves.  So it is words and phrases like, "You will learn, You will receive, you will benefit from etc".

It seems intuitive and simple to understand, however, so many written content is not done like this and results in very poor user retention rates.  I will continue to develop my content writing skills in my future web development projects.

Having said that,  web development profiles are a little bit self indulgent by proxy of being your life's work, I still did, however, try my best to write for the user here.

Enclosed is a paragraph demonstrating that content.

<br/>



***Content Writing For The User:***
![Content from the portfolio](https://i.imgur.com/p1QNzJX.png "content written for the user")   
<br/>


# Lessons Learned - The Code

<br/>

Following on from the written piece from my portfolio above,  typical web development portfolios are known as static websites being on the account that there is really is no need for a database - the model part of the MVC architecture.

However, providing a form facility for users to contact you is very important and would usually be provided by a controller language such as PHP.

In this instance, I abstracted that server side task to a third party known as Netlify.  It is all done (after you have signed up at their website of course) via the built in netlify form attributes.  You can even add a honeypot protection for any spam that is to come your way.

Here is the code from this web portfolio project that illustrates this technique in action.

<br/>

***Code Snippet Showing The Workings Of Netlify In This Project***
![The Netlify Techniques](https://i.imgur.com/efcoDVr.png "The Netlify Techniques")

<br/>


With the above code, this abstraction layer means I will receive the email request from the user and Netlify enables you to make a bespoke message of that you received the message from the user.  Which see:

<br/>

***My Bespoke Return Message Via Netlify After User Completes The Form***
![The bespoke message for the end user](https://i.imgur.com/DmBp6nD.png "The bespoke message for the end user" )

<br/>


The Netlify examples above enabled me to code up a static website with email capability with only having to use three core languages - HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


<br/>

#### Why No Third Party libraries/frameworks?

<br/>

I could have used third party libraries and portfolio templates to expedite the development process of the portfolio project.  However, my aforementioned need, 'to know it all' got the better of me here and after university on top of my design theory learning, I went through an intensive process of learning CSS GRID, Flexbox, the use of the CSS preprocessor (SASS) for file compartmentalisation and block object modifier (BEM) to make CSS easier to debug and fix.  Additionally, I also dedicated two to three months learning, 'git' from the command line uploading to GitHub as I realised if I have to work in coding teams this would be essential to know.  



It was the long game, but I am so glad I did this.  CSS Grid and Flexbox properties are not intuitive, so it takes a while to get used to their idiosyncrasies.  However, once you have done that, executing your wireframe design becomes a very seamless process.  

Now that I took the time to cultivate these skills and techniques, this has enabled me to develop portfolio type sites very quickly resulting in the fastest website possible for the user given there are no third parties (apart for netlify of course) stacked on top of the core language.  

In fact my dissertation development project empirically proved this phenomenon - that the fasted websites are the ones developed with the core languages alone.  Here is the github for that dissertation project [(The Masters Dissertation Development Project - client side)](https://github.com/MichaelCrawley1/MscClientSide) [(The Masters Dissertation Development Project - server side)](https://github.com/MichaelCrawley1/MscServerSide1)

<br/>

#### Don't Reinvent The Wheel

<br/>


That is not to say I am against the use of libraries and frameworks.  Far from it, I will be making use of these tremendous technologies in the very near future.  My next development project will be develop using the React framework.

However, the reason I stayed away from frameworks for the time being is that, rightly or wrongly, depending on one's view, the university professors encouraged our student cohort to stay on the core languages until deep understanding is met.  

It is longer and harder process to go through sure, but the rewards will be for all to see.  They (the professors) were under the opinion that developing this way makes for the best developers as when it comes to using a framework, bugs will be easier to fix because the  developer fully understands the core language underneath.

Learning this way does, 'reinvent the wheel' and is to be avoided in the industry however by learning the core languages enables one to see and understand how the, 'wheel' was put together.  My best project to date is this [CRUD](https://github.com/MichaelCrawley1/metallicaTourProject) application that I coded from scratch with all the core languages.  This was my first true full stack project and enabled me to have a great appreciation for this, 'wheel' that is this complicated, heterogeneous, interdependent platform known as a web app.  Progressing with the frameworks now will give me great appreciation in what they are trying to do and I will develop and code accordingly.   


<br/>

#### CSS GRID & Flexbox

<br/>



CSS Grid and FlexBox have increased my confidence exponentially when it comes to using CSS.  Prior to these tools I was heading in the direction to join many others in using front-end CSS Frameworks like Bootstrap.  Not now.  Once I took the time to learn these (at first) unintuitive CSS3 methods and then apply in real life projects everything changed for me.  The stress of developing websites to match the design from the wireframe are almost obliterated using these powerful tools.  Centring Div and texts has never been easier.

You can use these tools in many different ways and I am sure other developers will have their own bespoke processes when using these tools.  Enclosed is a brief description of mine.

<br/>

***My CSS GRID System Explained***
![The CSS Grid System](https://i.imgur.com/2lmk2ci.png "The CSS Grid System")

<br/>

What the above image of the code comments is trying to convey is how I use CSS Grid for my development projects.  For those that are unaware, CSS Grid focuses on columns and rows.  Columns are horizontal blocks and rows are vertical top down blocks.  

The literature online suggests that GRID is for layout and Flexbox is for components.  Reason being GRID is two dimensional (columns and rows) whereas Flexbox is one dimensional (columns or rows, can't do both at the same time).

However going right away with the two dimensional approach of GRID to create your layouts creates problems at the HTML element level.  The problem it creates is that you lose the ability to keep the HTML semantic if you go layout first with columns and rows.  "Subgrid" is in development to get around this problem, however, since it is not available on all the major browsers yet I have came up with my own layout solution while keeping the HTML semantic.

My solution is that you can use GRID for layout first but you must only use GRID for rows first to maintain the ability to keep your HTML elements semantic.  If you do columns and rows first, you have to flatten the HTML structure to get it to work and this makes the document object model (DOM) very hard to follow being that is becomes not a regular HTML document tree structure.

Therefore, to keep that structure, it is best advised to only use rows on the GRID.  These rows will be each section from top to bottom of the site.  In each of these sections is when you can then do another GRID of rows and columns to get the design you are looking for and maintaining this important semantic HTML.  This will enable your site to look professional and be responsive.  Furthermore, Flexbox is used within the GRID to mostly centre the div blocks and to space out the child elements evenly





<br/>

#### BEM

<br/>

The cascading nature of CSS can make one's development project very hard to follow and debug, especially when it becomes an application of any scale.  

Portfolio sites do not really have this problem of scale (they are usually quite small applications), however, I took this opportunity to learn a CSS naming convention called Block Element Modifier (BEM).  

The reason I did this was I was finding the nested CSS elements that I was creating were proving harder and harder to keep track of.  With BEM everything is a class, nothing is nested.  This brings its own positives and negatives.

The positive is that is does flatten the CSS and makes CSS incredible easy to debug and change.  The negative is that it is very class heavy, classes go on every element.  This could be construed as time consuming.  However, I noticed the more I used BEM, the extra classes became to feel a natural part of the development process and didn't really add too much to the development time.

Enclosed is an example of using BEM practices with this project.  Which see:

<br/>

***A BEM Example In This Portfolio Project***

![BEM In The Project](https://i.imgur.com/logp3Fv.png "BEM In The Project")

<br/>


<br/>

#### KeyFrames

<br/>


I got introduced to the power of keyframes in this project because of a need to animate the modal pop ups for the portfolio projects.  I found that the tired and tested CSS property transition wasn't doing the job this time.  That was because I was toggling the pop-ups between the, 'display: none' and 'display: block' CSS properties.  Unfortunately it is not possible to use the transition property on a, 'display:none' element.

The only way to animate on a, 'display:none' element is with key frames and with javascript on an event called, 'animationend'.

The name you give to the keyframe is what goes on the animation property of CSS.  I like to think of as a keyframe as a CSS function, if there is such a thing.  In that, whatever you name the keyframe is the, 'kind-of' function call under the animation property in CSS.

Perhaps an example may better illustrate what I am trying to say.


<br/>

***The Keyframe Names With Arrows***
![Arrows Pointing to the keyFrames name](https://i.imgur.com/S8OHGtj.png "Arrows Pointing to the keyFrames name")

<br/>


The figure up above is showing via the use of the orange arrows what the name each of the keyframes are called.  One as you can see is called, 'smoothPopUp' and the other is called, 'smoothPopOut' done in camel case.  

You can see it is going to animate over the opacity property.  The time of the animation going from 0 to 1 in opacity will be shown via the animation property itself.

The, 'smoothPopUp' keyframe is completed going from, 'display: none' to, 'display: block' and it is vice versa with the, 'smoothPopOut' keyframe.  Furthermore the, 'display: block' or 'display: none' property are acted on first, however, the 'opacity' property via the keyframe animation makes it seem that the opacity is called first due to the slow, deliberate animation.

Enclosed is a javascript snippet and then a visual navigation of the site of how this animation action occurs.

<br/>


***JavaScript Code Snippet For The Animation In This Project***
![javascript code for the animation](https://i.imgur.com/KHYmuw8.png "javascript code for the animatio")


<br/>

Here is the visual navigation of how the animation works with the keyframes on display:none.  First you hover over the modal you want to view, then, shown by the light blue arrow you click on the square and then the animation showing by the previous javascript code begins.

<br/>

***Click On The Blue Arrow To Begin The Animation***
![Click On The Modal](https://i.imgur.com/r8nOqzs.png "Click On The Modal")


<br/>

When the modal has been clicked on, the modal then, 'pops-up' with a small animation using the previous shown keyframe all done dynamically by javascript. This is best illustrated via a screenshot on the google chrome dev tools.  Which see;


<br/>

***Visual Representation Of The KeyFrame Animation In Action***
![Google Chrome Dev Keyframe Illustration](https://i.imgur.com/UDTewy1.png "Google Chrome Dev Keyframe Illustration")

<br/>


What this figure above is showing quite well, is the visual execution of the javascript code of when a user clicks on one of the modals.  From how the modal goes from, 'display: none' to, 'display:block' showing by the orange arrows and then how it takes that, 'display:block' and then performs an animation on it using the keyframe named, 'smoothPopUp' shown by the turquoise arrows.


The opposite happens when the user clicks on the, gold 'X' with the keyframe, 'smoothPopOut' shown by the red arrow.

To sum up, the keyframe method is certainly more complex that the transition method of CSS. However, it does give you more animation options, particularly when the solution seems to be not as intuitive.  This is something that I have added to my growing toolbox of UI manipulation and will be sure to use this again in future projects.


<br/>

## Last But No Least - The Power of Commenting The Codebase

<br/>     

In this project I have opted to comment every line possible. From the HTML code to the JavaScript code. This was a deliberate strategy. However when I eventually do become employed as a developer my future comments will be less intense as there will be less need to be as explicit with your comments because your code competency will not be questioned as severely as it will be at potential employment stage. Incidentally, I have subsequently found there was more utility in commenting the HTML side of things rather than the CSS side of things - CSS is the properties used, HTML gives you the chance to explain the CSS solution used.


<br/>


**For Potential Employers To View**

<br/>

I am now making a big push to gain commercial web developer experience. I am fully aware of the risk to potential employers and clients alike and the questions they need answered when hiring a new, junior-level developer. If they are to risk in taking on a junior developer they will want to know does this potential developer know why he/her used the code in the way that they have?

After a year or two of study most of us students can find a way to, 'hack a development solution'. However, it takes far greater study and time to understand why the solution you have, 'hacked' works the way it does and therefore to communicate that programming wisdom gained to others. This I feel is an essential skill to cultivate if a developer has aspirations working within development teams and pitching to new clients.

So what better way to show potential employers and clients alike that, as an aspiring junior developer, that you do know the solution you chose works the way it does by explicitly showing and telling them how through code comments?


<br/>

**Other Benefits To Commenting The Code Base**

<br/>


The benefit to heavily commenting code doesn't just stop with explicitly showing potential employers and clients that you know what you are doing. It also has the pleasant consequence of encouraging better solutions and opportunities for code refactoring too.

Heavy comments encourages one to be very analytical and forensic with their code base. One is able to see problems very quickly that don't adhere to DRY (Don't repeat yourself) and SR (Single Responsibility) principles and amend accordingly.

Furthermore, forensically looking at the CSS code base encouraged me to get rid of repeating properties and redundant CSS classes.

# Conclusion

<br/>

Despite my mild annoyance at having to prove myself job worthy after completing my masters in mobile and web development, this portfolio project was a great use of my time.  I learned loads, particular from a design and a CSS point of view.  The understanding why a site should look the way it does merged well with my business mind.  Design, I see now is not just for aesthetics, but to compel the user to stay on your site and, 'act on something'.

Moreover, the UI side has always been the bottleneck for me moving forward to the job market.  I always felt I was, 'hacking' a design and not really in control of it.  That is no longer the case.  CSS GRID and Flexbox with BEM practices makes me feel in complete control of the design.  This allows me to focus on the dynamic capability of the site to provide a superior user experience.

I feel I am now ready to be employed or contacted out as a full stack/junior web developer and hopefully you agree.

Kindest Regards
