  <!---html classes will be set up using the Block Element Modifier (BEM) styled system.  My method will involve letters with dashes (-) as a prefix to enable the reader to understand if a section of code is a component or a layout element.  Glossary is displayed below:

        c- = this equals a component that is likely to get reused
        l- = this equals a class that acts as block layout like a reusable container for example
        h- = the h prefix is to signify helper classes like clearfix to get elements back in the html document flow
        js- = this is to signify when we need to use JavaScript on an block or a block element to bring in dynamic functionality.
        c-js- = will refer to both components and components that rely on JavaScript functionality
        c-mq- = will be for media queries.

        In addition, throughout this document there will be a comment that says, "MODIFIER HERE, PLEASE SEE CSS COMMENTS FOR WHAT THIS DOES OR WHAT IT IS FOR".  By using the find search tool provided by the editor (control or command F) we can quickly find the modifier we are looking for and then look at the corresponding css file to see what it does.

        <!-----AND EXPLANATION OF THE CSS GRID SYSTEM USED BELOW---->


        <!---below is the class of the standard grid and is for rows only (this is used for the vertical layout of the pages), each row is to correspond with a new section of the html.  By using the grid system this way rather than rows and columns from the beginning, helps to keep the html semantic. Alternatively, using the grid for rows and columns at the beginning of the design means the html will have to be flattened for it to work.  When the, 'subgrid' property becomes more widespread with browsers perhaps this will not need to be the case, but for now, a grid for rows only for the vertical layout and then horizontal grids in each section thereafter if the need arises to keep it semantic---->

    <!-- FIRST COLUMN GRID WITH HERO IMAGE -->

    <!-- this section class does quite a lot here, first it has three columns with 5% margin column sections and with 3 fixed ratio rows grid.  It also has the hero image displayed as a background with 83% opacity to make it easier to write over.  Lastly it has a individual property of grid column: 1/-1 to stretch the hero over all the column sections.  The background colour of black takes the original hero image and gives it the colour effect we need.  Lastly it has an id of heroHome to make the scroll effect work from the mobile and the desktop menu layouts when the anchor tags are pressed   -->

My development journey thus far has been one of deep learning of the LAMP stack (PHP, MySql) with core UI manipulation skills with HTML5 CSS3 and Javascript.  Everything that has been developed up until now has been with all core languages. No frameworks have been used.  That is way my university cohorts and I were taught, therefore it made sense to carry on with that method of learning after I graduated.  This doesn't mean I am framework averse, on the contrary, it is more of a preparation of what I progress to next.  Knowing the core language underneath the framework, serves one best when it comes to deciphering the inevitable error and bugs during the development iteration cycles.   </p>

This is know as a static website.  My portfolio site you are visiting is one such site with a api plug-in via netlify so you can send me mail in the contact form below.  Furthermore, I can take that static build one step further and make your website dynamic by building and connecting the data to a database using MySql while utilising a, 'back-end' programming language (PHP) to communicate with said database so one with no development experience can create, delete, update or delete their website data.  This is known as a CRUD application.  View the Metallica project down below in the, 'My Work' section for a relevant example.

                                    <p class="c-pop-up-project-content-description">To justify teaching a student to masters level in web development means that a significant part of the academic process is theoretical and involves lots of literature research.  Sometimes this  indulgence in the theoretical method of research is not the, 'best practice' when it comes to considering practical developer employment positions in the future.

                                    My academic advisor was very aware of this and stressed to the student cohort that when it comes to doing the dissertation, that, in his view, it was, 'best practise' to undertake a development project rather that a theoretical one.  The reason for him to give this advice, is that given that the eventual job of a web developer is a very practical one, (creating applications from enabling, quite often, five different programming languages to communicate to one another) therefore, it would serve the masters student best that he/she could showcase these needed industry practical skills via their dissertation project.  That is exactly what I done.

                                      <p class="c-pop-up-project-content-description">
                                        This dissertation used four popular JavaScript Libraries (JLs).  Namely; jQuery, MooTools, Dojo Toolkit and Ext.js. Other JLs where considered, but with further research it was found they hadn't been updated for a very long time.

                                    </p>

                                      <p class="c-pop-up-project-content-description">

                                          The objective was to compare load speeds with these JLs while using AJAX techniques to consume and parse a bespoke web service's ( built by myself) movie data and take this data and display it at the client side.  The informational data structures at the web service for the client to consume was the same data in three different data formats.  Namely; json, xml and plain text.  The control language at the web service's end was PHP.   
                                      </p>

                                        The aforementioned paragraph suggests there was a lot of technical rigour going on to make this development project work and that assumption would be correct.  It was not an easy task to complete, part of which makes me so proud to have done it.

                                         Consistency was the toughest thing to achieve in this research.  I had to test all the libraries under the exact same environment constraints. They all got tested with their CDN library versions and with their minified for, 'production' code base.

                                         </p>  
                                          <p class="c-pop-up-project-content-description">
                                         Furthermore, to automate these tests, as automation takes away human error - I developed, with the help of stack overflow, a batch testing script that would run these JL applications 10000 times and display the average speed of these 10000 runs.  In retrospect this batch testing script is the thing I was most proud of creating.

                                     </p>

                                         Proud of because it was the most difficult thing to do at my coding journey at the time back in 2019.  I noticed that similar research already done, utilised manual tests in their research and manual tests are very error prone and not thought of very highly when it comes to academic research.  I wanted to avoid any human errors in my research. Of which, potential employers are likely to find the results very interesting.

                                        jQuery (the most popular JL) loaded the same application significantly slower that the less popular JLs.  Dojo, (one of the least popular JLs) absolutely destroyed the others when it came to consuming and loading the web server's data.  Dojo was tremendously fast and throughout the research I found out why.  Dojo doesn't load it's whole code base at once like the other JLs do.  It only loads the code used, much like you were doing if you were only using vanilla javascript.  It does this with its in-built AMD technology.

                                     <p class="c-pop-up-project-content-description">If employers that read this and are tied to industries that have severe developmental time constraints but also at the same time a strong need to create the fasted websites possible,  then perhaps using the JL Dojo will help achieve that aim and give you a competitive advantage to those  companies that don't.  I appreciate it is not as simple or as binary as that, but still something to strongly consider.</p>


                                     <p class="c-pop-up-project-content-description">

                                        Having said that, the results of DOJO, invoked a new thought to contribute to the research.  Just how fast is DOJO?  Is it near the speed of the core language itself?  Therefore the core language, JavaScript that these JLs are stacked on top off was brought in to the testing arena beside these JLs.  Again the results were very interesting.  

                                    </p>

                                    As one would expect, the core javascript applications were faster than all the JLs but only just when it came to DOJO.  Talking the odd millisecond differential here in speed, so not really significant to notice.  That showed me that while the Core Language still has great utility for applications to be coded, 'raw', DOJO shows you can still get that web performance speed with significantly less development time than the core language.  A very interesting finding. 

                                </p>



                                 <p class="c-pop-up-project-content-description">
                                    Furthermore, another amazing finding to come across is that with the JLs, the data format XML was the quickest to load its applications.  Whereas JSON was the quickest to load with the core language.  The project didn't find the answer as to why that was the case.  However, I suspect is must have something to do with how these AJAX techniques are coded into these JLs.  They seem to fuse very well with the XML document tree structure as opposed to the JSON one.
